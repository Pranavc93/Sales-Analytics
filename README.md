# Sales-Analytics
This repository contains Python code to analyze product sales data

The premise of this project is based on the fact that it often becomes imperative for a business to understand the trends and patterns in sales to drive customer satisfaction and increase sales which would increase the revenue generated through sales. Hence sales analysis is a vital activity that would aid a business in generating insights from sales data. The idea of the project is to generate insights from sales data, trends in sales, which product sells best, which are the top performing products and which underperform, and which combination of products gives maximum revenue, and build a model that analyses the purchasing pattern of consumers so that "Store" can achieve maximum profits. The intention of the project is to implement the apriori algorithm to generate association rules for a frequent itemset and justify the findings by computing three important metrics like support, confidence, and lift.The project follows the general steps towards a data analytics project involving data acquisition, data preparation, information modeling, and visualization.
